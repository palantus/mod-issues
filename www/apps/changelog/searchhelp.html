	<p><strong>General:</strong>
		The search will take place while typing. If you separate keywords with space, it means that the results needs to contain both conditions (i.e. AND). Pipe (|) is OR, thus the results needs to contain one of the keywords. A keyword can be negated by using exclamation mark (!) before a keyword.</p>
	<p><strong>Advanced search:</strong>
		Typing colon before a term signals that it is a special term. Currently the following are supported:
		<ul>
			<li><b>TBD</b></li>
			<!--
			<li><b>:closed</b> - issue is closed</li>
			<li><b>:open</b> - issue is not closed</li>
			<li><b>:dev</b> - issue has status created or in development</li>
			<li><b>:def</b> - your default assignment</li>
			-->
		</ul>
		In addition to the above special terms, it is also possible to use special terms with arguments, where you need to write the term before colon and then the argument(s). The following keywords are supported:
		<ul>
			<li><b>issue</b> - a list of issue numbers separated by comma (eg. "num:1799,1798")</li>
			<li><b>issuequery</b> - TBA</li>
			<li><b>user</b> - TBA</li>
			<li><b>type</b> - TBA</li>
			<li><b>change</b> - TBA</li>
		</ul>
